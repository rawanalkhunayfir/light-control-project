# 📌 Project Title  
**Remote Lighting Control System using ESP32**

## 📄 Description  
A collaborative graduation project by a team of five students specializing in Network Systems Administration. The project aims to develop a smart lighting control system using Wi-Fi and the ESP32 microcontroller. It allows users to remotely turn lights on and off through a mobile application, enhancing convenience, energy efficiency, and smart home integration.

## 🛠️ Features  
- Wireless control of home or office lighting via Wi-Fi  
- Integration with a mobile application (developed using React Native)  
- Real-time switching of lights (on/off)  
- Designed with safety and energy efficiency in mind  
- Uses open-source development tools (VS Code, ESP32)

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Improve energy efficiency  
- Provide convenient lighting control  
- Support smart home adoption  
- Deliver a scalable and secure IoT-based solution  

## 🧰 Tools & Components  
- **ESP32** – Main controller with Wi-Fi support  
- **Relay Module** – Controls power to lights  
- **Breadboard & Jumper wires** – Circuit prototyping  
- **Light Bulbs, Switches** – Electrical components  
- **Mobile App** – Built using React Native in Visual Studio Code

## 💡 System Workflow  
1. ESP32 receives commands from the mobile app via Wi-Fi  
2. Relay module acts based on the command to turn lights on/off  
3. User interface allows room-by-room control  
4. Circuit built and tested on a breadboard  
5. Final components enclosed in a protective casing for safety

## 📱 Mobile Application  
- Developed using **React Native** in **Visual Studio Code**  
- Interfaces include:  
  - Living Room  
  - Bedroom  
  - Kitchen  
  - Office  
- Each interface allows individual light control
